                Your city tour will commence with the visit to one of the wonders of the ancient world -the
                Sigiriya Rock Fortress. It is also a UNESCO world Heritage site. Sigiriya Rock was once an

                The magnificent rock fortress of Sigiriya is visible for miles from all directions and
                dominates the surrounding plain. The Sigiriya Complex consists of the central rock, which
                arises abruptly 200 meters above the surrounding plain with the two rectangular precincts on
                the east and the west. The rock is surrounded by two wide moats, where crocodiles were
                introduced in ancient times and three ramparts. The moats and walls that surround the lower
                palace are still exquisitely beautiful. Your next destination will be the Dambulla Cave
                Temples. It is the largest and best-preserved cave temple compound in Sri Lanka. There are
                above 80 chronicle caves around this location. The most prominent allures are advanced over 5
                caves, which contain statues and paintings. These paintings and statues are depicted to Lord
                Buddha and his life. There are a total of 153 Buddha statues, 3 statues of Sri Lankan kings
                and 4 statues of gods andgoddesses. (Entrance fees to sites not included). Additional tours

                Polonnaruwa, and Trincomalee districts. The park earned revenue of Rs. 10.7 millions in the
                six months ending in August 2009. Along with Kaudulla and Girithale, Minneriya forms one of
                the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) of Sri Lanka. The park is situated 182 kilometres (113 mi)

              <h2>Galle</h2>
              <p>
                Galle is a beautiful city to witness the sun and sand. Galle Harbor was frequented by Chinese
                and Arabians sailors before the Portuguese occupied Galle in the 16th century. The Dutch
                captured Galle in 1640 and handed it over to the British in 1796. History reveals that the
                Chinese Admiral Zheng He, who commanded seven great voyages through the South China Seas and
                the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1433, erected a tablet in 1409 in Galle in commemoration of
                his second visit to Sri Lanka. The trilingual tablet discovered in 1911 has inscriptions in
                Chinese, Tamil and Arabic languages, suggesting that the Chinese were dealing with a
                cosmopolitan trading community at that time.
