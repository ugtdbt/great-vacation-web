              <h2>Sigiriya Ancient Rock Fortress</h2>
              <p>
                Sigiriya consists of an ancient citadel built by King Kashyapa during the 5th century. The
                Sigiriya site contains the ruins of an upper palace located on the flat top of the rock, a
                mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its frescoes, the lower
                palaces clings to the slopes below the rocks. The moats, walls and gardens of the palace
                extended for a few hundred metres from the base of the rock. The site was both a palace and a
                fortress. The upper palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut into the rock.
              </p>
              <h2>Dambulla Rock Cave Temple</h2>
              <p>
                Located in central Sri Lanka, the Rangiri Dambulla Cave Temple is a living Buddhist site that
                is focused on a series of five cave shrines. Inhabited by forest-dwelling Buddhist monks since
                the 3rd century BCE, these natural caves have been transformed continuously throughout the
                historical period into one of the largest and most outstanding Buddhist complexes in the
                Southern and South Eastern Asian region, showcasing innovative approaches to interior layout
                and decoration. In keeping with a longstanding tradition associated with living Buddhist
                ritual practices and continuous royal patronage, the cave shrines underwent several renovation
                and refurbishing programmes before assuming their present interior forms in the 18th century.
                The vast internal spaces of the cave shrines are not compartmentalized, but are spatially
                differentiated by a deliberate and subtle arrangement of polychrome sculpture of exceptional
                craftsmanship and decorated with brilliant compositions of mural paintings. This spatial
                hierarchy and purposive interior layout devoid of physical divisions lead the devotees
                systematically through the spacesfrom one ritual function to the next. The site is remarkable
                in the Buddhist world for its association with the continuous tradition of living Buddhist
                ritual practices and pilgrimage for more than two millennia.

                the middle of the town , is a lovely place for a stroll or a picnic . Seasons may be absent
                elsewhere in Sri Lanka , but here you can read them by the flowers , which bloom in the spring
                ( March to May ) and the fall ( August and September ) . These are the " seasons " when low -

              <p>
                Galle has it all: historic colonial sights, meditative temples, sandy beaches and rivers
                teeming with wildlife, all of which make this southern seaside escape a must-see on most Sri
                Lankan travel itineraries. Its origins are ancient; as a seaport it dates back millennia.
                Cinnamon has been shipped from here for a thousand years and it was to these shores and
                Galle’s natural harbour that King Solomon came for ivory, peacocks and other island valuables.
                Following Portuguese and then Dutch colonisation, this was a hotspot on the spice trading map
                and the main port for Sri Lanka for 200 years, until the arrival of British, who shifted the
                main port to Colombo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today Galle is a tale of two cities: the bustling New Town feels worlds away from the
                frozen-in- time colonial-era nostalgia of its Old Town, secreted away within the coral and
                granite walls of the seventeenth-century Dutch fort overlooking the ocean. Many come to Galle
                just to wanderthe quiet, quaint streets of this living museum and UNESCO World Heritage Site,
                yet there is much more to this place, especially for lovers of wildlife. Combining tours of
                cultural wonders with nature spectacles like blue whale-watching, bike rides and river trips,
                here is our ultimate four-day insider’s guide to Galle, giving you where to go, stay, eat,
                drink and see in this unique city.

                coral sanctuary along the coast of Hikkaduwa is a large shallow body of water surrounded by a
                reef, decorated with layers of multicolored corals, and is home to countless colorful fish.
